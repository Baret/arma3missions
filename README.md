We share ArmA3 missions for regular events here. All mission makers commit their missions into this repository.
##HowTo:
- Checkout the project under [my documents]/Arma3/MPMissions
- You will have the arma3missions folder in there which is no problem for the amra editor
- Create your mission in the arma3missions folder
- When you have a working version, "extract to Multiplayer" in the editor and copy the generated pbo file from [ArmA3 folder]/MPMissions into arma3missions/releases
- Commit the release with a commit message like "TvT MyMission 1.0". For tracking purposes it is good to have the version number in there
